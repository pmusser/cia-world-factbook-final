Often referred to as “the paradox castle,” it was built at a time when castles were no longer necessary, and it was outfitted with the latest technological comforts such as an elevator, running water, electricity, telephones, and central heating. King Ludwig lived off and on in the castle for six months before dying in 1886. A few weeks after his death, the castle opened to the public as a museum; today it welcomes millions of visitors each year.",
            "caption": "Neuschwanstein Castle, located in the foothills of the Alps in Germany, is the best known of the three royal palaces built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Construction began in 1869, and although it was inhabitable by 1873, it was never finished. Often referred to as “the paradox castle,” it was built at a time when castles were no longer necessary, and it was outfitted with the latest technological comforts such as an elevator, running water, electricity, telephones, and central heating. King Ludwig lived off and on in the castle for six months before dying in 1886. A few weeks after his death, the castle opened to the public as a museum; today it welcomes millions of visitors each year.",

European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations, including the EC (now the EU) and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War allowed German reunification to occur in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.",
