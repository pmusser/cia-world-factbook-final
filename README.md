# CIA World Factbook: final content captures from the Wayback Machine

In the interest of LOCKSS, I'm sharing the content I got from the internet archive on 2/6/2026 and 2/7/2026. It's a bit of a mess and very much raw-data-y, but you can find formatted versions of the data, including images, audio, and recreated PDF's of the fact sheets and travel sheets [here](https://digitalpublicgoodslibrary.org/ark/search?f.search=World+Factbook).

If you like this and want to support more data rescue efforts focusing on educational resources, let me know.
